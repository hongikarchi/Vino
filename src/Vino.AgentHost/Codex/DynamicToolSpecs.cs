        PAYLOADS — first call artifact_write with one JSON object per operation (exactly {"bridgeOperation":"...","arguments":{...}}), then set payloadArtifact to that session-relative path. Property and enum names are camelCase.
        bridgeOperation mapping:
        - moveComponent/setLayout -> canvas.move {operationId,pivots:{guid:{x,y}},expectedFingerprints:{guid:sha256}}
        - setValue -> canvas.setNumberSlider {operationId,objectId,expectedFingerprint,value,minimum,maximum,decimalPlaces} (Number Slider only)
        - connectWire/disconnectWire -> canvas.setWire {operationId,wire:{sourceObjectId,sourceParameterId,targetObjectId,targetParameterId},action:connect|disconnect,rejectCycles:true} — batch freely: the server defers per-wire recomputes so a multi-wire ChangeSet solves ONCE at the end (deferSolve is server-owned; never author it)
        - createComponent -> canvas.create {operationId,objectId,componentTypeId,pivot:"gptino:auto",autoUpstream:[objectId,...],nickName,resultOutput} — ALWAYS use pivot:"gptino:auto" and list in autoUpstream the objectIds of the components/sliders that will feed this one; the server computes a clean, non-overlapping downstream position (sources left, results right). autoUpstream is optional and valid ONLY with the sentinel. Hand-pick pivot:{x,y} ONLY when the user asked for a specific location (an explicit point must NOT carry autoUpstream). componentTypeId must come from the well-known GUID table (gh-authoring skill) or a component_catalog lookup in this session — never write a type GUID from memory. resultOutput is REQUIRED (present, may be null): the name of the output socket this create is meant to PRODUCE as of THIS change — the server then auto-attaches outputCountInRange "<name>:1:*" on it, so a producing change whose output comes out EMPTY fails instead of committing green. Set it ONLY when this change actually makes the component produce (you wire its inputs in this same change, or it produces from its own defaults); use null when you are only scaffolding (adding a component to wire in a later change). You cannot omit the field — that is how the server forces the produce-or-scaffold decision.
        - referenceRhinoObjects -> canvas.referenceRhinoObjects {operationId,objectId,rhinoObjectIds:[guid,...],paramType:curve|brep|mesh|surface|point|geometry,pivot:"gptino:auto",autoUpstream:[objectId,...],nickName} — creates a typed GH parameter that PERSISTENTLY REFERENCES existing Rhino objects by GUID (a live reference, not a baked copy). This is how "use the curves/geometry I selected in Rhino" becomes an editable definition: reference the selected object ids here, then wire this parameter downstream — never re-author the geometry in a script. writeSet is grasshopperComponent with gptino:absent, exactly like createComponent (it creates a new canvas object at objectId). Pick paramType to match the selection; "geometry" accepts mixed types. pivot works exactly like createComponent's (the sentinel accepts an optional autoUpstream:[objectId,...]; an explicit {x,y} point must NOT carry autoUpstream).
        - deleteComponent -> canvas.delete {operationId,objectId,expectedFingerprint} — deletes a component OR a group box. A group is a document object too: pass the groupId as objectId to remove an empty/leftover group record (its members are NOT deleted — a group box holds no data). This is how you clean up the "· "-named ghost groups a rebuild leaves behind.
        - setGroup -> canvas.setGroup {operationId,groupId,name,objectIds,argbColor}
        - updatePythonSource -> python.setSource {operationId,componentId,expectedSourceSha256,source,runtime:csharp|cpython3|ironPython2,expireSolution} — the python.* operations drive every Rhino 8 script component regardless of language; runtime must match the component that was created. source must be Rhino 8 SCRIPT-MODE text — plain top-level statements only, no class/GH_ScriptInstance/RunScript wrapper; declare sockets via setComponentIo and read/assign socket-named variables. Use expectedSourceSha256:"gptino:auto" (a fresh component's seeded template hash is unknowable; the fingerprint chain still guards concurrent edits) — pass a concrete sha only to assert a specific prior source
        - setComponentIo -> python.setSchema {operationId,componentId,inputs,outputs,preserveIncidentWires}. Appends sockets only (for removal use replaceComponentIo below): list every existing socket in order, then appended ones. Each socket is {name,access,typeHint?,optional?} — OMIT parameterId and nickName (server-assigned and reconciled by position; nickname defaults to the name; missing typeHint defaults to a generic object socket). optional:true lets the component SOLVE with that input unwired (the script variable is None/empty — code the default in-script); a non-optional input left unwired blocks the whole script from running ("failed to collect data") with NO runtime error, so declare optional:true on every input the script can default. Scalars fed by sliders stay generic (coerce in-script); any socket carrying GEOMETRY between components needs the geometry type hint (point3d, vector3d, line, curve, plane, mesh, brep, surface, geometry, ...) on BOTH ends or the receiver gets an untyped/Guid value.
        - replaceComponentIo -> python.replaceSchema {operationId,componentId,newComponentId,inputs,outputs,source?,socketMap?,resultOutput} — SOCKET REMOVAL, as one atomic replacement: the adapter creates a fresh component of the same type at the same pivot, rebuilds its sockets to EXACTLY the declared inputs/outputs (this is the complete new schema — sockets you leave out are the removals), sets source (null copies the original's source verbatim), rewires every original connection onto the same-named socket (socketMap {"oldName":"newName"} carries renames), deletes the original, and solves ONCE. newComponentId is a fresh GUID you pick — after commit it IS the component's id (update your notes; the old id is gone). Original connections whose socket has no successor are dropped and reported in the result. Must be the ONLY operation in its ChangeSet; writeSet declares just the REPLACED component (grasshopperComponentIo, concrete or gptino:auto — the replacement needs no entry). resultOutput works exactly as on createComponent (REQUIRED, may be null). Replacing a live component another session authored takes the same approval path as deleting it.
        - replaceSourceBlock -> python.replaceBlock {operationId,componentId,expectedSourceSha256,blockId,source,expireSolution} — ID-addressed block edit on a CONSOLIDATED component (one produced by consolidate_stages): replaces exactly ONE stage block's statements; the stage markers, seam assignments, and meta header are server-owned and survive untouched. source is the block's plain script-mode statements only (no markers/seams/meta). The server splices it into the component's CURRENT stored text at dispatch and validates the block interface first — the block must exist, every output the meta header declares for it must still be assigned, and its seam-fed inputs must not be re-declared; a violation fails clean before any write. expectedSourceSha256 works exactly like updatePythonSource's ("gptino:auto" typical); writeSet declares the component's grasshopperComponentSource domain exactly like updatePythonSource. For edits that outgrow one block, use updatePythonSource with the full text (which ends the component's merged status) or consolidate_stages action:split.
        - convertSocket -> python.setTyping {operationId,componentId,inputParameterId,typeHint,access:item|list|tree}
        - executePython -> python.execute {operationId,componentId,expireUpstream,recomputeDocument}
        - readRuntimeMessages -> python.runtimeMessages {componentId}
        - createRhinoPrimitive -> rhino.createPrimitive {operationId,objectId,logicalEntityId,kind,one matching primitive definition,attributes}
        - transformRhinoObject -> rhino.transform {operationId,objectId,expectedFingerprint,matrix:{m00..m33}}
        - Rhino create/modify/bake/attributes -> rhino.upsert {operationId,objectId,logicalEntityId,geometryType,geometryJson,attributesJson,expectedFingerprint}
        - deleteRhinoObject -> rhino.delete {operationId,objectId,expectedFingerprint}
        - fixRhinoEndpointPair -> rhino.fixEndpointPair {operationId,anchorObjectId,anchorEnd,moveObjectId,moveEnd,expectedAnchorFingerprint,expectedFingerprint,tolerance} — heals one audited near-miss pair: the anchor is declared as a READ (fingerprint from the audit finding), the move object is the single write; ends are 0=start/1=end; tolerance is the audit's reported value. Verified before the write — a failed strategy changes nothing.
        - ensureRhinoLayer -> rhino.ensureLayer {operationId,layerId,fullPath,parentLayerId?,argbColor?} — creates a layer by full path (use "Parent::Child" nesting) or updates the one already at that path. YOU pick layerId: for a new layer declare it in writeSet as kind rhinoLayer with expectedFingerprint 'gptino:absent'; for an existing one use its concrete fingerprint from rhino_layers. The new layer's id is only usable by LATER ChangeSets (a move in the same ChangeSet cannot reference a layer that does not exist yet). argbColor is optional — omit it to KEEP an existing layer's colour (a new layer takes Rhino's default).
        - purgeTableEntries -> rhino.purgeTableEntries {operationId,entries:[{table:block|dimStyle|linetype|material,id}]} — deletes unused document-table entries; "unused" is re-verified live at execution, so an entry that gained a reference since the audit is refused. Declares no rhinoObject writes.
        - moveObjectsToLayer -> rhino.moveObjectsToLayer {operationId,items:[{objectId,expectedFingerprint}],targetLayerId} — attribute-only batch (geometry untouched); this is ALSO the quarantine vehicle for invalid objects. Every item's objectId needs its own exact rhinoObject writeSet expectation whose fingerprint equals the item's.
        - updateRhinoLayerProperties -> rhino.updateLayer {operationId,layerId,expectedFingerprint,argbColor?,visible?,locked?,userText?,renderMaterial?,setCurrent?} — presentation only; rename/re-parent are NOT available (they rewrite descendant paths and break GH name filters). userText is a {key:value} map of "gptino."-namespaced semantic labels (other namespaces are refused; an empty or whitespace value deletes the key); labels sit OUTSIDE the layer fingerprint, so a label-only update never invalidates CAS pins — and OUTSIDE Rhino Undo and layer-state snapshots, so the only revert for a label is writing an empty value. renderMaterial accepts only "plaster" (matte material matching the layer colour) and is FILL-EMPTY-ONLY: a layer that already has one keeps it and the skip comes back as a diagnostic, not a failure. setCurrent:true makes this layer the document's current layer — Rhino never hides the CURRENT layer, so to hide it first make another layer current in its own update (setCurrent never combines with visible:false: the current layer must stay visible). writeSet resource kind is rhinoLayer.
        - deleteRhinoLayer -> rhino.deleteLayer {operationId,layerId,expectedFingerprint} — only an empty leaf layer (no objects incl. hidden and block members, no children, not current); emptiness is re-proved at execution. writeSet resource kind is rhinoLayer.
        - saveRhinoLayerState -> rhino.layerState {operationId,action:save|restore|delete,name} — named layer states; save one BEFORE a layer sweep so the whole sweep is revertible without touching geometry. Declares ONE write of kind rhinoLayerTable whose id is the projectId you already put in the ChangeSet envelope (the Rhino document's identity — the layer table is Rhino's, so sibling .gh documents share one CAS domain and Rhino-only work needs no .gh at all) and whose expectedFingerprint is the table fingerprint from rhino_layers (a restore rewrites every layer, so the whole table is the CAS domain).
        - reads use {objectId} for canvas/Rhino or {componentId} for script components
        DECLARATIONS:
        - owner follows from the operation kind, never from you: every rhino.* is rhinoBridge, every python.* is script, every canvas.* is canvas. A mismatch is rejected before anything runs.
        - Every operation read needs a readSet fingerprint; every write needs an exact writeSet expectation. Unused expectations and payload-unrelated writes are rejected. Typed reads keep writes empty; a read-only ChangeSet keeps writeSet empty.
        - Resource ids: field='*'; lowercase D-format UUIDs (8-4-4-4-12) for object resources. A wire's writeSet id is the exact string sourceObjectId/sourceParameterId>targetObjectId/targetParameterId in N format (32 hex, no dashes) — same guids as the payload. If a payload-alignment error reports the expected id, declare exactly that string and resubmit.
        - Write domains are exact: move/layout=grasshopperComponentLayout; slider setValue=grasshopperComponentValue; component create/delete=grasshopperComponent; wire=grasshopperWire; group=grasshopperGroup; python source|schema-or-typing|execute=grasshopperComponentSource|grasshopperComponentIo|grasshopperComponentValue; Rhino OBJECT mutations (createPrimitive/transform/upsert/delete/fixEndpointPair/moveObjectsToLayer)=rhinoObject; ensureRhinoLayer/updateRhinoLayerProperties/deleteRhinoLayer=rhinoLayer; saveRhinoLayerState=rhinoLayerTable; purgeTableEntries=each entry's own table kind. Two operations in one ChangeSet cannot write overlapping domains.
        - Fingerprints are PER-DOMAIN: take the concrete fingerprint from the SAME resource kind you declare (move -> the grasshopperComponentLayout resource, setValue -> grasshopperComponentValue, delete -> grasshopperComponent). Independent edits no longer stale each other: a concurrent component move does not invalidate a pending value write.
        - Python source/I/O/value writes share whole-component state: one ChangeSet writes exactly one Python component, contiguously, with no other writes mixed in.
        - Canvas points are exactly x/y; Rhino points/vectors exactly x/y/z. Rhino geometryJson must be native RhinoCommon JSON matching geometryType; attributesJson is native ObjectAttributes JSON or "" for defaults. Distinct Rhino object IDs in one ChangeSet use distinct case-sensitive logicalEntityId values.
        BOOKKEEPING (server-owned):
        - Set expectedSnapshotId='gptino:auto', baseSnapshotRevision=-1, and existing-resource writeSet/readSet expectedFingerprint='gptino:auto' — the server fills them from this session's own last write; a genuine foreign change still Blocks.
        - Creates (createComponent, referenceRhinoObjects, createRhinoPrimitive, createRhinoObject, bakeGeometry, connectWire, a new setGroup, a new-layer ensureRhinoLayer) use writeSet expectedFingerprint='gptino:absent'.
        - Value/geometry payload+writeSet fingerprints (setNumberSlider, move, delete, rhino transform/upsert) must be the concrete value, not gptino:auto; payload fingerprints for existing resources must exactly match writeSet. For createRhinoObject/bakeGeometry only, payload arguments.expectedFingerprint is null.
        - acceptancePredicates may be [] — the server attaches the standard set (creates/bakes/groups objectExists, deletes objectAbsent, wires wireExists/wireAbsent, everything else runtimeErrorAbsent). BUT a change meant to PRODUCE a result must not commit empty. For createComponent, declare it through the required resultOutput field (the server then auto-attaches outputCountInRange '<name>:1:*' — do NOT also hand-write that predicate). For a producing change that is NOT a create — e.g. wiring or typing that makes an EXISTING component finally output — add outputCountInRange '<outputName>:1:*' yourself on that component. objectExists/runtimeErrorAbsent never inspect outputs, so without this an empty producing change commits as a false success.
        - APPROVAL: destructive ops (delete/modify/transform/fixEndpointPair/moveObjectsToLayer) on objects WITHOUT Vino provenance stamps — the user's own geometry — are refused unless changeSet.approvalGrantId carries the id the user minted by approving on the panel's audit card. Vino-created objects need no grant. Never invent a grant id and never author approved/sourceDocKey fields — the server injects them.
