/// Which document targets the AgentHost has CONFIRMED it registered, keyed by stable target key.

/// Registration used to be fire-and-forget: the plugin sent a frame and never learned whether it
/// arrived. That was survivable only because every target existed before the AgentHost was even
/// spawned, so the replay at connect covered them all. The moment a target can appear LATER — a
/// Grasshopper file opened mid-session, a Save As rebind, a Rhino-only runtime that a definition
/// joins afterwards — a single silent drop stranded it forever, and a live gate spent hours on a
/// bridge that reported "connected" while one target had simply never registered.
///
/// Confirmation is per (target key, generation): a Save As re-registers the same live document at a
/// higher generation, and the old confirmation must not be mistaken for the new one.
///
/// Deliberately has no timer. The plugin already knows when documents appear — it raises the
/// observation events itself — so this only needs to answer "is this one confirmed?" and let the
/// caller retry against a real reply. A heartbeat would burn power to rediscover what the events
/// already said.
